# Cyberpunk-Live-Background 

I've created a modern, advanced cyberpunk live background that combines multiple animated elements:
Features:

Animated grid background that moves continuously
Floating particles with random movement patterns
Matrix-style code rain with Japanese characters and binary
Glowing orbs that orbit around the screen
Geometric shapes (triangles, squares, circles) that rotate
Pulse effects that expand and fade
Data streams that flow vertically
Scan lines for that retro CRT effect
Neon text with realistic flickering animation
Interactive mouse trail with glowing effects
Dynamic color changes every 5 seconds

The background uses pure CSS animations and JavaScript for smooth performance, with a cyberpunk aesthetic featuring neon colors (cyan, magenta, green) against a dark gradient background. All animations are hardware-accelerated and optimized for smooth playback.
